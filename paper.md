## Details

I think 3 subfields need to be emphasized, **Depth Estimation, Layout Estimation, Features or Camera Localization**

In general, supervised approaches are better than un-, self-, semi-supervised approaches, but it is still worth to spend time to follow those researches. For example, in this [Digging Into Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01260.pdf), they generated very high quality depth maps from a self-supervised method.

I collected some SOTA researches from these subfields, it might be helpful. Suggestion: High quality researches could be found from some top conference competitions (even better than their main conference papers). Since they are fairly evaluated on the same benchmark, you can easily choose what you want.

Andrej Karpathy's blog might have some practical skills, like this [Recipe](https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/) (or other researchers could also tell us how to train a neural network). But for deep learning, unfortunately, acdamia can give very limited empirical or heuristic suggestions about how to trian a awesome neural network, so I guess make hands dirty and do sufficient ablation studies would never be wrong.
